Proxy ARP is a technique by which a proxy server on
a given network answers the Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP) queries for an IP address that is not on that
network. The proxy is aware of the location of the
traffic's destination and offers its own MAC address
as the (ostensibly final) destination.
--------------------
For Communication between different subnets packet has
to reach router or layer3 devices to process this packet.
If another networks is directly connected then forwards
packets on basis of ARP table . If destination is on
another networks means forwards packet to next hops
on basis of route entry Configured on network.

advantage:
The main advantage of a proxy ARP is that it can use
a single router on a network for communication with
the all the machines on the network.

disadvantage:
(1)Hosts need larger ARP tables in order to
handle IP-to-MAC address mappings.
(2)Security can be undermined. A machine can
claim to be another in order to intercept packets,
an act called "spoofing."
