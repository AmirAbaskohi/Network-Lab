Yes it sends as we can see the deliver message and ICMP messages.
Ping uses the ICMP or  Internet Control Message Protocol to check if a host is up. 
ICMP is a protocol in the network layer that communicates error messages
and other conditions that require attention, as well as routing information.
These messages are used by the ping program to determine if a remote host
is accessible. ping sends ICMP echo requests to the target IP address. The
target host will respond with an ICMP echo reply for each ICMP request
correctly received. The round trip time for each request/reply pair may be
reported in the ping console. The fact that no ICMP echo reply is received
means either that there is no path available to the remote host, or the remote
host is not alive.
